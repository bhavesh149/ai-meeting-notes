Daily standup meeting transcript:

John: Good morning everyone. Yesterday I completed the user authentication module and started working on the password reset functionality. Today I plan to finish the password reset feature and begin unit testing. No blockers currently.

Sarah: Hi team. Yesterday I reviewed the API documentation and found several outdated endpoints. I updated the documentation and added examples for the new summarization endpoints. Today I'll be working on the frontend integration and testing the new API responses. One potential blocker - I need clarification on the email notification format.

Mike: Morning all. I set up the automated testing pipeline yesterday and ran the initial test suite. Found 3 failing tests related to database connections. Today I'll fix those test failures and add more comprehensive coverage for the API endpoints. No blockers.

Lisa: Good morning. Yesterday I prepared the client presentation and gathered feedback from the previous demo. Today I'll incorporate the feedback and schedule follow-up meetings with key stakeholders. Need to coordinate with the development team on feature timelines.

Meeting ended with agreement to have a follow-up sync on Friday to review progress and plan for next sprint.
